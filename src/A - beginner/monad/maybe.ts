Each monad could be expressed using either "of" ("pure", "return") and "flatten" or "of" and "chain" ("bind"):
- "of" wraps a value in the context;
- "flatten" rips off one layer of a container, turning F<F<A>> into F<A>;
- "chain" takes a function from A to F<B>, a value of F<A> and returns F<B>.

What's interesting â€“ "flatten" and "chain" could be expressed in terms of each other.
